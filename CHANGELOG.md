## 0.1.0

Rename project
Migration to the null safety

## 0.0.8

* add linux example app
* sign out when the userinfo endpoint returns 401
* if the user info is null but we have a valid token we try to fetch the user again

## 0.0.7

* add requestScopes

Note: `GoogleSignInTokenData` exposes `serverAuthCode` field that should
contain the exchange code from the authorization request. This will
always be null when using this package because we already allow you to
provide a code exchange endpoint witch exposes the code and code
verifier in a trusted environment and encourages not to do the code
exchange on the client.
